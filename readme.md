If you do not have a flat bed or ADF scanner at home. This allows you to take a photo instead with your mobile phone or digital camera.

The camera scanner can then:

Iterate through a collection of images.
Automatically crop the documents.
Correct the perspective distortion.
The aim of this project is to provide an efficient way to capture these images from the desktop using video or photos.

It's quite simple and mostly relies on the dependencies which need to be installed:

python
opencv with cv2 bindings
matplotlib
This is currently a work in progress backup. But if this is useful for others let me know and I'll update more often.
